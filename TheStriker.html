            <h1>Reliability:</h1>
            <p>
                The Striker's engine is built to perform under extreme stress, utilizing forged pistons, high-strength connecting rods, and a reinforced crankshaft to ensure durability. A dry sump lubrication system prevents oil starvation
                during hard cornering, enhancing reliability during spirited driving. The Striker is designed for endurance, with regular maintenance allowing it to perform flawlessly even after years of heavy use.

            <h1>Engine:</h1>
            <p>
                At the heart of the Striker is a 5.2L V10 engine, delivering 640 horsepower and 600 lb-ft of torque, built for sheer power and high-speed capability. This naturally aspirated engine roars with intensity, thanks to an active
                exhaust system that amplifies the engine note at high RPMs. The Strikerâ€™s engine is coupled with a dual-clutch 7-speed transmission, ensuring lightning-fast shifts, making it ideal for both track days and aggressive street
                driving.
