### Description of the product
 - For this assignment we are planning on building a website about a car company. The car company and its products will be made up for the sole purpose of this assignment. We started off with 5 cars but considering the length of the assignment, we decieded to stick with 3 cars whih would allow us to make 4 pages in total. The user is able to explore each car on their dedicated page while the main page is to grab attention and show off the company. The user is also able to fill in their data to book a test drive with a time preference which allows us to use both radio buttons for time and check boxes for the cars they would like to testdrive. The images will be generated using ChatGpt and so will the description and features of each car. We are also planning on having our locations tab where users are able to view our randomized location. Along with the adress, the user is also able to use the link provided to take them to Google Maps.

# Part 2
> This is where you should describe how the Gestalt principles apply to your site

### Gestalt principles write-up (point form)
> Include images here to make your points easier to understand (and you will have to write less too!)

1.
images/Proximity.png. This image is of the table to find the best car for your needs from our website and shows how proximity is used. This table has features for each car listed right under and is overall very close together. This makes it clear that each row of the chart corresponds to a specific characteristic such as, design focus, etc for all three cars, helping users quickly compare the models.

2.
images/Similarity.png. Similarity is present in this example as all the cars in the similar lighting and positioning. All three cars have the exact same "Learn More" button under them which further unifies this section having a similarity element.

3.
images/Symmetry.png. Another Gestalt principle present is Symmetry. This elemnet is present in the "Book A Test Drive" section. All of the elds such as, Name, Phone Number, etc, are all alligned symmetrically and make it easier to look at, as it is arranged in a pleasing way.

4.
images/CommonFate.png. This principle is present in the "Learn More" buttons on the main page of our website. This is Common Fate as all of these button serve a very similar function which suggests to the user that clicking any of them will lead to a similar result as they all move the same in a certain sense.

5.
images/Closure.png. Closure is another element our website uses in the form of our logo. The logo has gears but in the middle of the gear it is blocked by our company name "TorqueWerks", yet we still know that behind the name the rest of the gears are there. 

6.
images/Figure&Ground.png. This element is showcased by how the cars on the main page are distinctly outlined against the background making the cars pop out much more.

7.
images/Continuity.png. Continuity is present within the Comparison Table. This is due to how the table has the criteria on the left hand side which makes it read left to right for each feature ensuring smooth reading, without having to skip over irrelevant information.
